## Project description: Exploring the difference between schools of philosophy

### Dataset:

This dataset contains over 300,000 sentences from over 50 texts spanning 10 major schools of philosophy. The represented schools are: Plato, Aristotle, Rationalism, Empiricism, German Idealism, Communism, Capitalism, Phenomenology, Continental Philosophy, and Analytic Philosophy.

### Project description:

The main parts of this project are listed below:

- Conducted exploratory data analysis to learn the distribution of every feature in our dataset; 

- According to the sentences of each school of philosophy, plotted wordclouds to learn the word pattern of each school; 

- After vectorizing our corpus, clustered different schools together to understand the similarity between them; 

- Finally, designed an algorithm to predict the corresponding school by applying logistic regression on the token matrix

### Results:

On the test set, the model accuracy is about 76%. The outcomes of our prediction model are consistent with clustering results
